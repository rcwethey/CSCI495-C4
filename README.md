# CSCI495-C4

## Description / Purpose
This project was done so that I can show the difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid. The time saved and code saved once again but even more so than Flexbox. It is just an easier way to do CSS and SASS. Hence another framework. 

## Dependencies
devDependencies:
    autoprefixer: 9.6.1,
    concat: 1.0.3,
    node-sass: 4.12.0,
    npm-run-all: 4.1.5,
    postcss-cli: 6.1.3

## Usage
Used HTML, SASS, CSS, and in CSS: CSS Grid. this was used to do less coding. 

## Future Work
For future work i can greate more pages por popups that are obviously more functional and this could work with JS, Node.js for a database and React for more functional things once I actually learn Reach and Node.js.


## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
Once again, my major is IS and when i graduate I want to go into Web Development. This is once again a faster way to code that will save time and processing power. This will also allow me to go more indepth into what I want to do. My next project will without a doubt atart to work with JS.
